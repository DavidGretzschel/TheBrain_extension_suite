v0.2

* replaced font_color_selection with multi_markdown-function to change font-family, font-size, font-color, background color to something specific with just one command
* try alt+shift+h for an example and adapt to your needs

* added new keybindings:

alt shift m for opening new window from search [Content maximized]

alt shift m for opening new window from search [Plex maximized]

alt shift o for opening Attachment without activating underlying Thought

alt l [follow text-link in new Content-maximized window]

They will only work with my specific keybindings or by adpating the code in a few places with your own.
My keybindings/explanation how to modify will be added later.

v0.3
Modified keyboard shortcuts and made conflict-free with defaults. This should be much easier to learn, now.
